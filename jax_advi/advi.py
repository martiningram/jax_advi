    """Minimizes the KL divergence between the posterior defined by the
    `log_prior_fun` and `log_lik_fun` and a mean-field variational Bayes
    approximation using a factorised normal distribution. Based on the variant
    of ADVI detailed in "Covariances, Robustness, and Variational Bayes" by
    Giordano, Broderick and Jordan
    [https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v19/17-670.html].

    Args:
        theta_shape_dict: This is a dictionary containing the shapes of the
            parameters to perform inference on.
        log_prior_fun: A function taking in the dictionary of parameter settings and
            returning their log prior density.
        log_lik_fun: A function taking in the dictionary of parameter settings and
            returning their log likelihood.
        M: The number of Monte Carlo samples to use to optimize ADVI. Defaults to
            25. More is better, but yields diminishing returns. Giordano et
            al. suggests 10 may be enough, so 100 should be fairly conservative.
        constrain_fun_dict: A dictionary of the constraints the parameters have to
            satisfy. For example, variance parameters are constrained to be positive
            and can be constrained with the `constrain_positive` function. The
            constraint function must return the constrained parameter as well as the
            log determinant of the Jacobian of the transformation.
        verbose: If True, prints the value of the objective and the norm of its
            gradient at each iteration of the optimisation.
        seed: A random seed for reproducibility.
        n_draws: The number of draws to return. Can be set to None if no draws
            are desired.

    Returns:
    A dictionary of results. It contains the fields "free_means" and "free_sds"
    listing the unconstrained variational parameters, "opt_result" containing
    the results of the optimisation, and "draws" if n_draws is not None, which
    is a dictionary of draws from the constrained parameters. In general, these
    should be used rather than the free means and sds since they have been
    appropriately transformed.
